  <p> As a computer science student, I enjoy using my knowledge and skills to help others. This summer, I'm working as a TA at a cybersecurity camp to teach community college students basic cybersecurity concepts and explore careers in this field.<br>
    This role has provided a great boost to my teaching and public speaking skills. I'm looking forward to learn new technologies and collaborate with others to build new things
